# Student-Asset-Manager

Description:

The University Rental System is a Python-based application designed to facilitate the rental and management of assets within a university or college environment. This system allows students to rent items such as books, bikes, and other equipment, while providing administrators with tools to track rentals and manage inventory.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for both students and administrators.

Item Rental: Students can browse available items, rent them for a specified duration, and view rental history.

Inventory Management: Admins can add, remove, or update items in the inventory, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

Cost Calculation: The system calculates rental costs based on the duration and a customizable per-day rental price.

Database Integration: Utilizes SQLite for persistent storage of rental transactions, enabling data retrieval and analysis.

How to Use:

Enter the item, duration, and renter's name.
Click "Rent" to initiate a rental transaction.
Admins can manage inventory and view rental history through the interface.
This project aims to provide a practical solution for managing university resources efficiently and promoting a seamless rental experience for students.
